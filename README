We are writing a book about Perl 6.

It will be some kind of example-driven introduction to Perl 6, and at
the same time showing off the reasons why we love that language.

We plan to have monthly releases, see docs/release-guide.pod

"We" are Carl MÃ¤sak, Jonathan Worthington, Patrick Michaud, Moritz
Lenz, Jonathan Scott Duff (Scott) and anybody who's willing to work on
it.  If you're not on that list yet, you're still very welcome to join
us.

You can find us on #perl6book on irc.freenode.net.  Logs of the IRC
discussions: <http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6book/> (If you do not
have an IRC client, you can use a web-based client at
<http://webchat.freenode.net/?randomnick=1&channels=perl6book&prompt=1>
)

To build the book, you need to have the following software installed:

    * GNU make
    * perl 5.10
    * the Perl 5 modules:
      Pod::PseudoPod::LaTeX version 1.101050 or newer
      Template version 2.22 or newer
    * inkscape (for svg -> pdf conversion)

    * A number of LaTeX packages (see lib/*.sty). Ubuntu 10.04
      supplies most of what is needed with its texlive-latex-base,
      texlive-latex-extra, texlive-xetex, texlive-fonts-extra,
      texlive-latex-recommended and texlive-font-utils packages.

    * Adobe's fonts and B&H Luxi Sans. To get those, install
      ttf-xfree86-nonfree (and uninstall t1-xfree86-nonfree) and
      Acrobat Reader then copy *.otf from
      /opt/Adobe/Reader9/Resource/Font/ to ~/.fonts/
	
    * Run 'sudo fc-cache -f -v' to rebuild the cache in case the fonts
      are not found.

The book is produced from src/*.pod chapters ultimately rendered into
dist/*.pdf using bin/* and lib/* files.

Just type 'make' on your command line, and the book should be built in
dist/UsingPerl6.a4.pdf, with an A4 paper size; to get U.S. letter
size, type 'make PAPER=letter'. To get any PAPER width and height type
'make PAPER=6.125in,9.25in'; accepted length units are pt, in, cm and mm.
