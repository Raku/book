=head1 NAME

Release guide for the Perl 6 book

=head1 SCHEDULE

We'll release monthly, and (conjectural) release three days after each parrot
release, so the Friday after the 3rd Tuesday of each month.

We want a good version printed for the Rakudo * release, which implies that we
should finalize in mid March 2010.

=head1 RELEASE PROCEDURE


=over

=item 0

Make sure you have the latest changes to the book by executing

    git pull

in your clone of the book repository.

=item 1

Summarize the major changes since the last release and put them in an
announcement.  Place the announcement in F<docs/announce/>.

Use the following command to see a chronology of changes:

    git log --since=YYYY-MM-DD --reverse

When you're done, commit the announcement and push it to the repo:

    git commit docs/announce/YYYY-MM
    git push

=item 2

Tag the release:

    git tag -a -m'Release YYYY-MM' YYYY-MM
    git push --tags

where C<YYYY-MM> is the four digit year and 2 digit month.

=item 3

Build the book by typing C<make release>.  This will create a file called
F<build/book-YYYY-MM.pdf> where C<YYYY> and C<MM> are the current year
and month respectively.

=item 4

Upload the generated file F<build/book-YYYY-MM.pdf> to
L<http://github.com/perl6/book/downloads>.

=item 5

Post the announcement to L<http://rakudo.org/> (node type I<story>).
